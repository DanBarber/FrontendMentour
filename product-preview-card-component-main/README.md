## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This time I decided to use pure CSS instead of BootStrap, in some ways it's easier and in other ways it's more challenging as basic stuff is not already done for you. The majority of the code is from a tutorial I found on YouTube as I was primarily focused on learning more than practicing.
