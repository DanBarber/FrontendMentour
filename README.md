# Frontend Mentour Challenges

This repo will be storing all my completed attempts at [Frontend Mentour challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The majority of these solutions will be in Bootstrap 5 and will use the [bs5-boilerplate](https://github.com/bradtraversy/bs5-simple-starter) by [@Brad Traversey](https://github.com/bradtraversy).

## Why Frontend Mentour?
I am admitedly not the best designer in the world, it's nice to have the design stuff taken care of so I can do the fun stuff, building and learning!

## Why Bootstrap 5?
Simply because a lot of enterprises use Bootstrap 5 and other CSS frameworks heavily, and also as I have been learning Bootstrap 5 via [@Brad Traversys](https://github.com/bradtraversy) [Bootstrap 5 from scratch course](https://twitter.com/traversymedia/status/1671900276029112323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1671900276029112323%7Ctwgr%5E29ec00e7543af2a80d98fd0ad22943960ab6d0e3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Ftraversymedia2Fstatus2F1671900276029112323widget%3DTweet). Which I highly recommend!
