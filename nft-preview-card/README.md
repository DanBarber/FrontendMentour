## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

Adding the overlay on the nft image was a lot trickier than I originally anticipated and took up most of my time with this solution. 

I was trying to nest the overlay and overlay image within child divs which later caused problems when hovering the mouse over the overlay image.

I feel the CSS could be optimized and there may be some repeated stuff, but overall I am pretty happy with the result.
